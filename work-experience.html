        <h3>Data Scientist – Sustainability Dictionary Project</h3>
        <p class="job-meta"><em>Atkinson Graduate School of Management | January 2025 – Present</em></p>
        <p>
            Sole undergraduate researcher on an NLP-based project to create a dictionary of sustainability terms. 
            Used Python, NLTK, and scikit-learn to preprocess and analyse a large corpus of sustainability-related including over 100 business sustainability reports and 50 academic papers.
            Using findings from the analysis, I used hierarchical (agglomerative) and non-hierarchical (k-means) clustering to categorize sentences. 
            Then using these clusters, I created a dictionary which was able to identify sustainable sentances with a __% accuracy rate and __% precision rate.
