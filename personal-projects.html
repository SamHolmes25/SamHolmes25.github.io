        <h3>Primer and Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h3>
        <p>
            Wrote a seven-page primer on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) from the perspective of abstract algebra. 
            Implemented both symmetric and public key schemes in Python, and analyzed the time complexity of Pollard's Rho attack.

        <h3>Singular Value Decomposition for Image Compression</h3>
        <p>
            Built an image compressor in Python using the NumPy library and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 
            Demonstrated differences in image quality and storage efficiency based on the number of singular values retained.
        </p>

    <div class="job">
        <h3>Abstract Vector Spaces and their Applications</h3>
        <p>
            Created a Python program to project arbitrary vectors onto subspaces with user-defined inner products. 
            Applied this tool to distributed computation of multivariable functions and implemented an $n$-dimensional Fourier Transformation from scratch.

        <h3>Exoplanet Detection Using Fourier Transformations and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram</h3>
        <p>
            Analyzed stellar brightness data to identify exoplanets using the transit method. 
            Wrote a computational essay detailing the use of Fourier Transformations and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in time-series astrophysical analysis.
        </p>

    <div class="job">
        <h3>Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Evaluation of Dark Matter Density Models</h3>
        <p>
            Used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) walkers and galaxy redshift data to evaluate parameter sensitivity in dark matter density models. 
            Estimated cosmological constants $\Omega_\lambda$, $\Omega_m$, and $\Omega_k$ through Bayesian inference.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="job">
        <h3>Quantum Algorithm Simulations</h3>
        <p>
            Built a simulation of a quantum computer in Python, using Numpy Linear Algebra to implement matrices as quantum gates, and vectors as quantum states.
            Both wrote code and a written explaination of the Deutsch, Deutsch-Josza, Quantum Fourier Transform, Phase Estimation, and Shors algorithms. Due to computational intensity
            of simulating a quantum computer, we are limited to 12 qubits.
